As part of [NYC OpenData Week](https://www.open-data.nyc), the computer science department at Hunter College has hosted a hands-on workshop for getting started with Python and OpenData.  This repository has the notebooks and handouts for the 2018, 2022, and 2023 workshops.  Interested in learning more?  Come join us at [Hunter College](https://hunter.cuny.edu)! We integrate NYC OpenData into our curriculum, starting with the [first computer science course](https://huntercsci127.github.io/s23.html).

### Overview

We'll start with a showcase of what's possible with NYC OpenData
and its uses across computer science at Hunter College.

<p>
Next, we will:

1. [Getting started with Python:](https://stjohn.github.io/datasci/openDataWeek/warmup.html) using turtles to map GIS data of [NYC libraries](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Library/p4pf-fyc4">).
2. <a href="https://gist.github.com/stjohn/ca92cb126f7cb6ae33a389f6b5cdf410">Using structured data</a>:  who gets the most <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2018/pvqr-7yc4">parking tickets</a> (using pandas).



And if there's extra time:

- [Making HTML maps (using folium):](https://gist.github.com/stjohn/412ee3b894f236379174c61bdfd7608f) mapping 
[WIFI locations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw) and 
[311 calls](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).
