<h2>Program Description</h2>


<p><a name="p1"><b>Program 1: School Counts.</b></b> &emsp; <i>Due noon, Friday, 8 September.
  <br>Learning Objective: to refresh students' knowledge of dictionaries and string functions of core Python, use constant models, and build competency with open source data portals.
  <br>Available Libraries:  Core Python 3.6+ only.
  <br>Data Sources: NYC Open Data: <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2021-DOE-High-School-Directory/8b6c-7uty">2021 DOE High School Directory</a>,

<p>
Welcome!  Each programming assignment this term has a similar structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>focuses on a data set, usually related to NYC,</li>
  <li>cleans the data to be used for analysis,</li>
  <li>builds a model, using some of the data, </li>
  <li>evaluates how well the model at predicting, using the rest of the data, and</li>
  <li>incorporates tests that the writen code perform correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Programs are submitted via Gradescope (see general notes above for details) and can only use the libraries specified above (echoing the restrictions of technical screenings).  For example, this first assignment only uses core Python libraries.</p>


<br><br>

<h3>NYC OpenData</h3>


Much of the data collected by New York City agencies is publicly available at <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC Open Data</a>.  For this program, we will use the overview of high schools maintained by the Department of Education and available each year for rising 9th graders to choose a high school:

<p>
<a href="https://myschools.nyc/en/schools/high-school">
  <img src="hs_dashboard_si.png" height="250">
</a></iframe>
</p>

The raw data for 2021 is available at:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2021-DOE-High-School-Directory/8b6c-7uty">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2021-DOE-High-School-Directory/8b6c-7uty</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since it is quite large (1.7MB), let's filter the data set to just be high schools in Staten Island:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click on the OpenData link above. Click on the <code class="inline">View Data</code> button. </li>
  <li>In the <code class="inline">Filter</code> region (either at the bottom of the page or on the right hand side, depending on your browser window size), choose <code class="inline">Select a column to filter</code> and choose <code class="inline">borocode</code>.</li>
  <li>Change the <code class="inline">is one of</code> to <code class="inline">is</code>.</li>
  <li>In the search box, put <code class="inline">R</code> (for Richmond County or Staten Island).</li>
  <li>Click the <code class="inline">Apply</code> button.  It will take a few seconds (it's a large file) but the rows filtered will be all the Staten Island high schools.</li>
  <li>To download the file, 
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the <code class="inline">Export</code> button.</li>
      <li>Under <code class="inline">Download</code>, choose <code class="inline">CSV</code>.</li>
      <li>The download will begin automatically (files are usually stored in <code class="inline">Downloads</code> folder).</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Move your CSV file to the directory that you save your programs. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Staten Island data set, create several other datasets for testing locally and to practice using the filtering on NYC OpenData. </p>


<p>Most of the data at NYC OpenData is stored in <code class="inline">comma-separated-values</code> or CSV format.  The first row is usually the column names for the data, separated by commas.  Each entry is in its own row, separated by commas.  For example, the first 5 rows of entire 2021 dataset are:</p>

<pre>

<p>
For this assignment, we are going to focus on the <code class="inline">overview_paragraph</code> column that contains a short description of each school. 
</p> 



<br>
<h3>Cleaning Data</h3>

<p><i>Note:  for this assignment, we are <b>not</b> using Pandas.  We will recap Pandas in Lecture 2 and use it in the next assignment, <a href="p2.html">Program 2</a>.  Instead, we're going to use the built-in file and string I/O in Python. If you're rusty on Python, see the chapters in the CSci 127 textbook:  <a href="http://learningds.org/ch/13/text_strings.html">DS 100: Section 13.1</a> (String Methods) and 
  <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//thinkcspy/Files/toctree.html">Think CS: Chapter 11</a> (Files).</i></p>

<p>Programming assignments are submitted as a single <code class="inline">.py</code> file.  If you use multiple files or notebooks, convert your program to a single <code class="inline">.py</code> file to submit to the autograder.  For this first program, we have set up a template (see <a href="p1_template.py">p1_template.py</a> and also included at the end of this page).  Edit the template to include your name, email, and resources and submit to Gradescope to make sure everything works. </p>

<p>Once you have downloaded some test data sets to your device, the next thing to do is format the data to be usable for analysis.  Add the following function to your file:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code class = "inline">extract_overviews(file_name)</code>:  Opens the <code class="inline">file_name</code> and from each line of the file, keeps the overview description of the school (the fifth "column": <code class="inline">overview_paragraph</code>). Returns a list of the overviews.
</ul>
<p>For example, starting with the Staten Island data set (and using the <code class="inline">textwrap</code> package to print prettily):

<pre><code class="blockcode">file_name = '2021_DOE_High_School_Directory_SI.csv'
si_overviews = extract_overviews(file_name)
print(f"Number of SI overviews: {len(si_overviews)}. The the last one is:\n")
print(textwrap.fill(si_overviews[-1],80))
</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">Number of SI overviews: 11. The the last one is:

SI Technical High School provides a robust liberal arts curriculum including
courses in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) and a
cutting edge Career and Technical Education (CTE) program. All students take an
Intensive Writing course and English and Language Arts curriculum to prepare
them for Advanced Placement (AP) Language and AP Literature and Composition.
Students take four years of mathematics, a variety of STEM and AP courses,
graduate with at least two or three AP Social Studies courses, and take three
years of the Russian language with an optional fourth year of a second language
via a blended learning program. All ninth grade students receive a computer to
use in school and to take home.
</code></pre>
<p>Running the fuction on the late start data set (schools that start 9am or later):</p>
<pre><code class="blockcode">late_name = '2020_DOE_High_School_Directory_late_start.csv'
late_overviews = extract_overviews(late_name)
print(f"\n\nNumber of late start overviews: {len(late_overviews)}. The the last one is:\n")
print(textwrap.fill(late_overviews[-1],80))</code></pre>

gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">Number of late start overviews: 30. The the last one is:

The mission of the Bronx International High School is to empower our students to
become active participants in today's interdependent and diverse world. We
accomplish this by helping enhance our students' cultural awareness, English and
native language proficiencies, and intellectual and collaborative abilities. We
are dedicated to serving the academic and social needs of recently immigrated
young people and their families. By critically analyzing and responding to
complex world issues, students achieve academic, personal, and professional
success as they become advocates for themselves and their communities.   
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have written your function, test it locally on the small test files.  When it works, upload to Gradescope. Given the size of the files that we evaluate your code, you will find it much faster to develop and test the code in your IDE than debugging and testing in Gradescope.</p>

<br>
<h3>Constant Model</h3>

<p>The first model that we will use is the <b>constant model</b> which predicts the same (constant) values for all inputs.  We saw examples in Lecture 1 and <a href="https://learningds.org/ch/04/modeling_intro.html">Chapter 4</a> with modeling restaurant tips and bus lateness.  We are going to build two models:  one that predicts the length of the overview paragraphs (in number of characters) and a second that predicts the number of sentences (using the number of periods as a proxy for the number of sentences.  To do that, we will use some of our datasets to compute values and determine a good constant for each one.  Since the datasets can be quite large, instead of storing the numeric values in a list, we will use a dictionary that keeps count of each time a value is seen (if you're rusty on dictionaries, see <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//thinkcspy/Dictionaries/toctree.html">Think CS: Chapter 12</a> or <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-python-3-from-scratch">Learning Python 3 from Scratch</a>).</p>

<p>Implement the functions below.  In the real world, you would likely combine these into one function, but we are implementing them separately to make partial credit and testing easier:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code class = "inline">count_lengths(overview_list)</code>:  For each element of the <code class="inline">overview_list</code>, the function computes the length (the number of characters in the string).  The results are stored in a dictionary of length occurrences where the keys are the lengths seen in <code class="inline">overview_list</code> and the values are the number of times each length occurs.  Returns the dictionary of length occurrences.
  <li> <code class = "inline">count_num_sentences(overview_list)</code>:  For each element of the <code class="inline">overview_list</code>, the function computes the number of periods (<code class="inline">.</code>) (as a proxy for the number of sentences).  The results are stored in a dictionary of occurrences where the keys are the number of periods seen in <code class="inline">overview_list</code> and the values are the number of times each occurs.  Returns the dictionary of occurrences.
  <li> <code class = "inline">compute_mean(counts)</code>:  Computes the mean (average) of <code class="inline">counts</code> dictionary weighting each key that occurs by its value (e.g. if the key of 10 has value 8, then the 10 showed up 8 times and adds 10*8 to the computation of the average). Returns the mean.     
</ul>

<p>
Continuing our example for the 11 Staten Island high schools:
<pre><code class="blockcode">si_len_counts = count_lengths(si_overviews)
print(f"The {sum(si_len_counts.values())} entries have lengths:")    
print(si_len_counts)</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">
The 11 entries have lengths:
{729: 1, 738: 1, 681: 1, 435: 1, 536: 1, 732: 2, 741: 1, 623: 1, 564: 1, 735: 1}
</code></pre>
Note that two entries have the same length.
</p>

<p>
Continuing our late start high school example:
<pre><code class="blockcode">late_len_counts = count_lengths(late_overviews)
print(f"The {sum(late_len_counts.values())} entries have lengths:")    
print(late_len_counts)</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">The 30 entries have lengths:
{38: 1, 634: 1, 528: 1, 743: 1, 748: 1, 385: 1, 753: 1, 27: 1, 684: 1, 512: 1, 680: 1, 477: 1, 722: 1, 741: 1, 106: 1, 739: 1, 732: 1, 700: 1, 750: 1, 551: 1, 733: 1, 399: 1, 22: 1, 679: 1, 723: 1, 31: 1, 73: 1, 710: 1, 655: 1, 616: 1}</code></pre>
</p>


<p>We can similarly compute the number of sentences:  
<pre><code class="blockcode">si_dots_counts = count_sentences(si_overviews)
print(f"The {sum(si_dots_counts.values())} entries have lengths:")    
print(si_dots_counts)
late_dots_counts = count_sentences(late_overviews)
print(f"The {sum(late_dots_counts.values())} entries have lengths:")    
print(late_dots_counts)</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">The 11 entries have lengths:
{4: 6, 7: 2, 3: 2, 5: 1}
The 30 entries have lengths:
{0: 5, 7: 2, 3: 3, 4: 11, 5: 3, 2: 1, 6: 5}</code></pre>
For these small examples, the overall lengths of the paragraphs were different, but the number of sentences were much more concentrated.</p>

<p>
We can compute the means as well:
<pre><code class="blockcode">si_len_mean = compute_mean(si_len_counts)
si_dots_mean = compute_mean(si_dots_counts)
print(f"Staten Island high schools overviews had an average of {si_len_mean:.2f} \
characters in {si_dots_mean:.2f} sentences.")</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">Staten Island high schools overviews had an average of 658.73 characters in 4.45 sentences.</code></pre>
</p>

<br>
<h3>Evaluating Our Model</h3>

<p>The next part of program evaluates how well our constant models do at prediction.  We will use a loss function, mean squared error, introduced in Lecture 1 and <a href="https://learningds.org/ch/04/modeling_loss_functions.html">Section 4.2</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code class = "inline">compute_mse(theta, counts)</code>: 
    This function takes two inputs:
    <ul>
          <li> <code class = "inline">theta</code>: a numeric value.
          <li> <code class = "inline">counts</code>:  a dictionary where the keys are numerical and the values are the number of occurrences. 
    </ul>
    Computes the Mean Squared Error of the parameter <code class = "inline">theta</code> and a dictionary, <code class = "inline">counts</code>.  See <a href="https://learningds.org/ch/04/modeling_loss_functions.html">Section 4.2:  Modeling Loss Functions</a> where this function is implemented using <code class = "inline">numpy</code> and assumes the values are in a list or Series.  Note that <code class = "inline">numpy</code> is not one of the libraries for this assignment and your function should compute MSE without using <code class = "inline">numpy</code>.    
    Returns the MSE.   
</ul>


<p>
Continuing our example of number of sentences in an overview:
<pre><code class="blockcode">late_dots_mean = compute_mean(late_dots_counts)
print(f"The mean for number of sentences in SI descriptions is {late_dots_mean}.")
losses = []
for theta in range(10):
  loss = compute_mse(theta,late_dots_counts)
  print(f"For theta = {theta}, MSE loss is {loss:.2f}.")
  losses.append(loss)</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">The mean for number of sentences in SI descriptions is 3.8.
For theta = 0, MSE loss is 18.67.
For theta = 1, MSE loss is 12.07.
For theta = 2, MSE loss is 7.47.
For theta = 3, MSE loss is 4.87.
For theta = 4, MSE loss is 4.27.
For theta = 5, MSE loss is 5.67.
For theta = 6, MSE loss is 9.07.
For theta = 7, MSE loss is 14.47.
For theta = 8, MSE loss is 21.87.
For theta = 9, MSE loss is 31.27.</code></pre>
</p>

<p>The smallest losses are near the mean of 3.8.  We can also visualize the lengths (as a histogram in blue) and the loss function in terms of theta (in red) using matplotlib:</p>
<pre><code class="blockcode">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
plt.bar(late_dots_counts.keys(),late_dots_counts.values())
plt.plot(losses, color='r')
plt.title('Sentences in late overviews')
plt.show()</code></pre>
which generates the plot:
<p><img src="late_sentences.png" height = 300></p>

<p>
This suggests that the best constant model for sentence length is 3.8.  Let's look at the Staten Island data (generated similarly to above) which has mean 4.45:
</p>
<p><img src="si_sentences.png" height = 300></p>
<p>Looking at the graph of the loss function (red line), it's minimized closer to 4.5 than 3.8.  So, our constant model built on late-starting schools does not do as well for predicting sentences in SI descriptions.  We will see in later lectures that the MSE loss function is minimized for the mean value (and that other loss functions achieve their minimum values at different values).</p>


<br>
<h3>Testing Code</h3>

<p>Each programming assignment includes functions that test that your code works (a "test suite").  We will first build these in core Python, and in future assignments (Programs 3-6), will introduce standard testing packages.</p>

<p>Your program should include the functions below that test if your functions above perform correctly.  Each of these functions takes a function as an argument.  You can write them in any order, but we have placed them easiest to hardest below:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code class = "inline">test_compute_mean(mean_fnc=compute_mean)</code>:
    This test function takes one input:
    <ul>
      <li> <code class = "inline">mean_fnc</code>: a function that takes one input parameter (a dictionary of counts) and returns a numeric value.  It has a default value of <code class = "inline">compute_mean</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    This is a test function, used to test whether the <code class = "inline">mean_fnc</code> returning <code class = "inline">True</code> if the <code class = "inline">mean_fnc</code> performs correctly (e.g. computes the mean) and <code class = "inline">False</code> otherwise. 
  
    <p><i>Hint: we will test your function with three different functions:  the correct one, one that returns the mean of the keys (i.e. doesn't use the counts when computing the mean), and one that always returns 42.</i></p>
  </li> 
    
  <li> <code class = "inline">test_mse(loss_fnc=compute_mse):</code>:
    This test function takes one input:
    <ul>
      <li> <code class = "inline">mse_fnc</code>: a function that takes in two input parameters (a numeric value and a dictionary of counts) and returns a numeric value.  It has a default value of <code class = "inline">compute_mse</code>.
    </ul>
    This is a test function, used to test whether the <code class = "inline">mse_fnc</code> returning <code class = "inline">True</code> if the <code class = "inline">mse_fnc</code> performs correctly (e.g. computes mean squared error) and <code class = "inline">False</code> otherwise. 
    <p><i>Hint: we will test your function with three different functions:  the correct one, one that returns the mean squared error of the keys (i.e. doesn't use the counts when computing the mean), and one that always returns 42.</i></p>
  </li> 

  <li> <code class = "inline">test_count_lengths(count_fnc=count_lengths)</code>:
    This test function takes one input:
    <ul>
      <li> <code class = "inline">count_fnc</code>: a function that takes one input parameter (a list of strings) and returns a dictionary.  It has a default value of <code class = "inline">count_lengths</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    This is a test function, used to test whether the <code class = "inline">count_fnc</code> returning <code class = "inline">True</code> if the <code class = "inline">count_fnc</code> performs correctly (e.g. creates a dictionary of counts of occurrences of lengths) and <code class = "inline">False</code> otherwise.
    <p><i>Hint: we will test your function with three different functions:  the correct one, one that returns the number of strings in the list, and one that always returns a dictionary with the key:value pair of 42:42.</i></p>
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
Trying first on the correct function:
<pre><code class="blockcode">print(f'test_compute_mean(compute_mean) returns {test_compute_mean(compute_mean)}.')</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">test_compute_mean(compute_mean) returns True.</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Continuing our example:
<pre><code class="blockcode">print(f'test_compute_mean( lambda x : 42 ) returns {test_compute_mean(lambda x : 42)}.')</code></pre>
gives the output:
<pre><code class="datablock">test_compute_mean( lambda x : 42 ) returns False.</code></pre>
The <code class="inline">lambda</code> in Python allows you to write small anonymous functions (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions">Python Docs 4.8.6 Lambda Expressions</a> for more details).
</p>

<h3>Program Template</h3>

<p>For this first program, we have included a template, <a href="p1_template.py">p1_template.py</a> to use to get started.  It includes function stubs and some testing in a (conditionally executed) main function:</p>
