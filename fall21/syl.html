<b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i> This topics course focuses on computational methods and statistical techniques to analyze data and make inferences.  Topics include data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, and statistical inference and prediction.  Students will acquire a working knowledge of data science through hands-on projects with real-world data.  Basic proficiency in statistics and Python programming is assumed, as well as experience with matrix algebra or abstract data structures.
<br><b>Prerequisites: </b> CSci 127, Stat 213, and one of: Math 160, Math 260, or CSci 335.
<br><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="https://stjohn.github.io">Dr. Katherine St. John</a>, professor (<a href = "../../officeHours.html">office hours</a>).
<br><b>Tech-in-Residence Fellow:</b> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanwsun/">Susan Sun</a>.
<br><b>Meetings:</b> Mondays, Thursdays, 2:45-4pm, on-line.


<h2>Grading Policy</h2>

<p><b>Course Format:</b> This course is taught in an <b>on-line</b> format with all lectures, quizzes, and exams given on-line:
<ul>
	<li> Synchronous lectures are Mondays and Thursdays, 2:45-4pm,
	<li> Asynchronous assessments (usually due 24 hours after lecture, depending on holidays),
  <li> Individual programming assignments and cumulative project, and
	<li> 2 hour final exam during the time slot assigned by the registrar.
</ul>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience.
Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading.
<!--Students should review topics from
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.-->

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's
<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity">Academic Integrity Policy</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>
Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</i>
</blockquote>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.



<p><b>Lecture Participation:</b> Participation in lecture is measured by attendance and related questions on that day's quiz.  There are 28 lectures, and the highest 25 participation grades are counted toward your final grade (that is, the lowest three grades are dropped).</p>

<p><b>Quizzes:</b> After every class, there will be an quiz on the lecture notes, code demonstrations, classwork, and submitted programs.</p>
<ul>
  	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
  	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.
  	<li> Quizzes are usually due 24 hours after lecture.
  	<li> There are no make-up quizzes. Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing quiz grades (the final exam will also replace a quiz grade when you take the quiz but do better on the final exam).
</ul>


<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually three weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and lab and serve as building blocks for the classwork and semester-long project.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must
perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style, and be submitted via <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>.
You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores).
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>

<p><b>Project:</b> A final project is required for this course. The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted program.



<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  It is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course.  Sample exam questions will  available on the course webpage.
<b>You must take and pass the final to pass the course.</b>

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Participation: 10%.	</li>
      <li>Homework: 25%. </li>
      <li>Project: 25%. </li>
      <li>Quizzes: up to 20% (if you miss a quiz, or do better on the final exam, your grade on the final will replace that quiz grade).</li>
      <li>Final Exam: 20% (up to 40% if you do better on the final exam than on quizzes). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
